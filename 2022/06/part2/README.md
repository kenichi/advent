# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 6 Part 2

How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?

## Setup

Left it the same as Part 1.

## Implementation

Literally could have just changed the 4 to 14 in the `reduce_until_repeat` guard, but also changed the function name just for good form.

## Running

`mix run`

## Testing

`mix test`
