# Advent of Code 2020 - Day 3 Part 2

Multiply the number of trees at each slope.

## Implementation

Ok, now we have to pull that slope out into another function, make it passable
all the way down from `eval()`. We'll add the various slopes there and multiply
so our output is the answer.

## Running

`mix run`

## Testing

`mix test`
