# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 2 Part 2

Sum powers of minimal sets for given games.

## Setup

Don't need `@bag` anymore. Instead parse to minimal sets, which are just
maximums of each color, then "power", meaning the product of all. Sum.

## Implementation

Lots o' `Enum.reduce`!

## Running

`mix run`

## Testing

`mix test`
