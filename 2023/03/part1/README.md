# Advent of Code 2023 - Day 3 Part 1

Sum of part numbers.

## Setup

This one weirdly broke my brain, until I used structs for state and reduced
over the coordinates.

## Implementation

`Schematic` and `Part` know what they need to, and `Advent.udpate_part` handles
the main logic, with `Advent.update_parts` following up with state.

## Running

`mix run`

## Testing

`mix test`
